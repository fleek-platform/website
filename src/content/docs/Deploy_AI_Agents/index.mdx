# Deploy AI agents

Fleek will soon be releasing one-click deployments for autonomous AI agents. This will allow developers to simply focus on the agent's personality traits and trustlessly deploy AI agents on Fleek. With support for Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and remote attestations, Fleek ensures that the execution of AI agents is both secure and verifiable. We enourage all developers to fill out the form below and be notified as soon as we release it.

# 3. Starting with a Template

If you’re looking for a quick way to get started, using a pre-built template is an excellent option.
Templates are pre-configured setups that you can customize to fit your needs.
Follow these steps to create an agent using a template:

Click on "Start with Template"
From the Get Started screen.

Finalize and Save
After filling in all the details:

Click "Continue" to review the setup.

The final step in creating and deploying your AI agent involves configuring environment variables.
These variables provide the necessary credentials and settings for your agent to interact with external services like OpenAI or social platforms.
Fill in sections below:
