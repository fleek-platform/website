# Deploy AI agents

Fleek will soon be releasing one-click deployments for autonomous AI Agents. This would allow developers to simply focus on the agent's personality traits and trustlessly deploy AI agents on Fleek. With support for Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and remote attestations, Fleek ensures that the execution of AI agents is both secure and verifiable. We support and enourage all developers to fill the form below and be notified as soon as we release it.
