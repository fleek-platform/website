## Using private data with Fleek Functions

Fleek Functions can be used to deploy logics that contain private and sensitive data like environment variables, various API Keys and more.

:::warn

This feature is only accessible via the Fleek CLI.

:::

You can make use of environment variables through any combination of the following:

- Those set within your CLI
- Those imported from a separate file
- Those exported into your local environment

:::warn

Your Fleek Function are stored on IPFS. They are publicly accessible by default, and will expose all of your code associated with the function including any environment variables which are bundled into your code. Ensure you are not inadvertently exposing data you are interested in keeping private.

:::

### Environment variables set within your CLI

You can pass `-e` or `--env` flags to the CLI in order to set simple, non-array environment variables from within the CLI. For example, the following code would set VAR1 as 'foo' and VAR2 as 'bar' for use within your Fleek Function.

```js
fleek functions deploy --name print-hello-world --path *./function.js --env VAR1='foo' --env VAR2='bar'
```

### Environment variables imported from a separate file

Additionally, you can pass a `--envFile` flag to the CLI, followed by a file location relative to the current directory, in order to load environment variables from a file. This file should represent variables using a key value pair syntax.

```js
# This is a comment
PORT=3000 # This is also a comment
NAME="Some value"
MULTI_LINE="THIS IS
A MULTILINE"
```

In the example below, the user's environment variables are located in an `env.list` file.

```js
fleek functions deploy --name print-hello-world --path *./function.js --envFile ./env.list
```

### Environment variables exported to your local environment

Lastly, you can use variables exported to your local environment.

If you have exported a variable to your environment with export VAR1='foo'and export VAR2='bar', e.g., you can run:

```js
fleek functions deploy --name print-hello-world --path *./function.js --env VAR1 --env VAR2
```

### Using your environment variables

Your environment variables are available under `fleek.env`. You can test it out with the following function:

```js
export const main = (params) => {
  const foo = fleek.env.FOO;
  return `foo=${foo}`;
};
```

## Making Fleek Functions private (ðŸ§ª Alpha)

If you are interested in making your Fleek Function code private, add the `--private` flag to your deployment command:

```js
fleek functions deploy --name print-hello-world --path *./function.js --private
```

:::warn
This is an experimental feature, performance will be impacted. We are actively working on improving this experience to be on par with IPFS stored functions.
