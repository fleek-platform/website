## List your Fleek Functions

Learn how to list all the Fleek Functions that you have created.

<Tabs>
<TabItem title="Platform">
To list the Fleek Functions within a project:

1. On the project's dashboard, click on the "Functions" button on the secondary navigation

2. All the functions created within this project will be visible here.

3. To find more functions in other projects, feel free to switch the project from the selector. This is how you can access different Fleek Functions created in different projects that you're a part of.

</TabItem>

<TabItem title="CLI">

To display all the Fleek Functions you've deployed in your Fleek project, execute the following command:

```js
fleek functions list
```

This command will output a table showing the `ID`, `name`, `slug`, and `Fleek Function invocation URL` for each of your Fleek Functions.
