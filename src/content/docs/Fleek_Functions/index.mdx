# Fleek Functions

Fleek Functions are code snippets that are executed server-side using Fleek Networkâ€™s on-chain cloud infrastructure.

Run the function below to see Fleek Functions in action ðŸ‘‡

<FleekFunction
  client:load
  functionUrl={'https://rapping-memory-tinkling.functions.on-fleek.app/'}
/>

These functions are a cost-effective, performant and scalable option for executing server-side code than popular alternatives such as Lambda functions, due to the architecture of the Fleek Network.
