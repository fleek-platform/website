# Fullstack Next.js

Fleek Supports fullstack Next.js apps with the help of Fleek Next Adapter. In the following section, you will learn how using the Fleek Platform and Fleek CLI, you can leverage these capabilities to build fullstack and performant Next.js apps.

<Tabs>

<TabItem title="Platform">
Deploying fullstack Next.js applications directly from the platform is a seamless process. You have to ensure you have the below in place first:

1.  **Configure edge runtime**:
    For routes with server-side code, add the following code to ensure they are configured to be optimised for edge runtimes:

    ```js
    export const runtime = 'edge';
    ```

2.  **The code already pushed to a remote repository on Github**.

## Deploying your Next.js application

On the platform's dashboard, click on the "Hosting" tab on the sidebar and then click on the "Add new" button. You will see a dropdown appear, click on the "Deploy my site" button. Then follow the below steps:

1. Select Github to connect your account on Github to the Fleek platfom. You will be prompted to authorize Fleek to access your Github repositories.
2. Next you choose repository that contains your Next.js application:
   {/* Image here */}
3. Click on "Show advanced options" to ensure all the details are correct including the environment variables:
   - **Environment variables**: You can add environment variables to your Next.js application here.
   - **Build command**: The build command for your Next.js application.
   - **Publish directory**: The directory where your Next.js application is built.
     {/* Image here */}
4. Click on "Deploy site" to deploy your Next.js application:
   {/* Image here */}
5. The deployment starts and you are navigated to the overview page for the deployment:
   {/* Image here */}

Your deployment completes and you can go to the overview page for the deployment to see the details of the deployment. You can also view the deployment URL for your Next.js application:

<TabItem title="CLI">

:::info
Install the [Fleek CLI](/docs) and [login](/docs/cli/#login) locally on your machine to be able to deploy your application.
:::

The Fleek Next.js adapter enables seamless deployment of server-side Next.js applications on Fleek, allowing users to host fullstack Next.js apps straight from the terminal with optimized performance and edge compatibility. With this adapter, you can deploy your Next.js app as a [Fleek Function](/docs/cli/functions), leveraging the edge runtime of the [Fleek Network](/docs/infrastructure/) to power your application efficiently.

We are going to walk you through the adapter, features it offers, and how to deploy your Next.js app with it on Fleek. This adapter supports both JavaScript and TypeScript Next applications.

You need to make sure that your **Node.js version is at least 18, check that your [Fleek CLI version](/docs/cli/#install) is at least version 3 and that you have a working Next.js application setup**.

## Install

:::note
You can use pnpm as well for installation.
:::

To install the CLI open your terminal and run the command below:

```sh
# Using npm
npm install @fleek-platform/next

# Global installation
npm install @fleek-platform/next -g
```

## CLI usage

To prepare your Next.js application for deployment on Fleek, follow these steps:

1.  **Configure edge runtime**:
    For routes with server-side code, add the following code to ensure they are configured to be optimised for edge runtimes:

    ```js
    export const runtime = 'edge';
    ```

2.  **Build the application**: Use the Fleek Next.js adapter to build and deploy your app from the command line

    ```sh
    npx fleek-next build

    # or if installed globally
    fleek-next build
    ```

3.  If running this command outside of your projectâ€™s root directory, specify the path with the `-p` or `--projectPath` flag:

    ```sh
     fleek-next build -p path/to/my/repo
    ```

### Build command options:

- **`-p, --project-path <path>`**: Path to your Next.js projectâ€™s root directory. Defaults to the current directory.
- **`-s, --skipBuild`**: Skips the build step, allowing you to build the application separately if needed. Default is false.
- **`-i, --skipInstallation`**: Skips dependency installation. Default is false.
- **`-c, --clean`**: Clears any previous build artifacts before building.
- **`-v, --verbose`**: Enables detailed logging.

## Deploying your Next.js application

:::info
To learn about support for Next.js features on Fleek, see the [documentation](/docs/platform/frameworks#nextjs-on-fleek)
:::

1. Before you can deploy your Next.js application you will first need to create a Fleek function with the below command:

   ```bash
   fleek functions create
   ```

2. You then note the name of the Fleek Function you just created because you will use it in the next step. Deploying your Next.js application after all the above steps is as simple as one command:

   ```sh
   fleek functions deploy --bundle=false --path .fleek/dist/index.js --assets .fleek/static
   ```

The above command will prompt you to [login to your Fleek account](/docs/cli/#login) from your CLI if you are not already logged in.

If you are logged in, you will :

1. Be prompted to choose a project on your Fleek account to deploy your application from:

   ```bash
   âœ” Select a project from the list: â€º First Project

   âœ… Success! You have switched to project "First Project".
   ```

2. Choose a Fleek Function to deploy your application to which should match the one you created above:

   ```bash
   âœ” Select function from the list â€º stuff
   âœ… Success! Assets uploaded successfully
   ```

The below is what you should expect to see while deploying:
