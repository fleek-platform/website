# Frameworks on Fleek

As you begin building on Fleek, you may be curious which types of projects you can build and any limitations that the use of our platform imposes. We aim to be a one-size-fits-all platform for a wide swath of use cases, and with that in mind have designed the platform to accommodate a variety of frameworks without requiring a cumbersome setup.

## Which frameworks does Fleek support?

Fleek supports a variety of frameworks and libraries for building sites and applications. It is largely framework-agnostic, though applications that leverage more popular frameworks can be auto-detected and configured with appropriate build settings, whereas applications built using less popular frameworks require some minimal configuration on the user's part.

### Frameworks supported by Fleek

You can check out the [templates](https://fleek.xyz/templates/) to see frameworks we have support for. Fleek supports a wide range of frameworks.

### Next.js on Fleek

Next.js is a fullstack React framework for the web designed to build feature-rich and scalable, modern frontend applications with ease. Fleek supports Next.js and offers a wide variety of features that make it easy to deploy all your Next.js applications.

#### Getting started

Deploying a Next.js project on Fleek is simple:

1. Get the [`fleek-next`](/docs/cli/fleek-next-adapter/) adapter
2. Configure the edge runtime Fleek offers to handle server-side code
3. Build for production
4. Deploy to Fleek, get your URL and view your site

#### Features of Next.js on Fleek

:::info
Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR), Partial Prerendering and Streaming support are being worked on and will be available soon.
:::

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Fleek enables SSR with edge runtimes, letting you render pages dynamically for use cases like authentication and location-based content. SSR scales automatically.
- **Middleware**: Fleek's Edge Middleware allows custom routing and personalization, making static content adaptable to user preferences or locations.
- **Service integrations**: Fleek supports integrations with popular services like MongoDB, Sanity, and more, streamlining environment setup and configuration. We offer [Edge SGX](/docs/cli/edge-sgx) for data security and privacy that can be paired with these external services.

We shipped [templates](https://fleek.xyz/templates/) to get you started with building your Next.js apps on Fleek. You can also learn how about the Fleek Next.js adapter we built and how to deploy your fullstack Next.js apps with it [here](/docs/cli/fleek-next-adapter/).

### Infrastructure compatibility for popular frameworks on Fleek

Below you see a table that shows infrastructure support for some of the most popular frameworks:

<FrameworkComparisonTable />

### Auto-detected frameworks

For the most popular frameworks bulleted above along with several other less popular frameworks, we can perform auto-detection to automatically apply the correct build settings. We will find the correct Docker image from our [Dockerhub organization](https://hub.docker.com/u/fleek) depending on the detected framework and offer support for additional frameworks through custom Docker images users create.

### Other frameworks: npm package dependencies

The frameworks we can auto-detect are a small subset of those we support, however. _Any_ framework that is a dependency for an npm package will be supported, since we apply a Node-based Docker image by default when none are selected.

### Additional framework support through custom Docker images

If you’re using a framework which is neither auto-detected by Fleek nor an npm dependency, that does not preclude you from using it for a project on Fleek, since you can always create your own Docker image to build the app. In this way, we can support nearly any framework that outputs HTML.

### Beyond frameworks: what types of applications can be built on Fleek?

Some elements of Fleek's platform are hosted on Fleek, including not only the docs you are reading now, but also the landing page and blog. Each of these applications is hosted on the [fleek.xyz](https://fleek.xyz) site.

At the moment Fleek is introducing more full stack capabilities. This will be done in a phased approach over time, as Fleek Network and web services needed are launched, hardened and tested. Fleek aims to be a one-size-fits-all platform for developers.

## Framework templates

If you're ready to start building with Fleek and have a favored framework in mind, we offer several templates for popular frameworks that make it easy to deploy an application to Fleek of those respective types. You can browse our templates [here](https://fleek.xyz/templates/).
