# Billing

Fleek’s billing system provides a flexible and scalable solution for managing subscriptions, payments, and billing cycles.
This enables users to be able to control their project’s operations costs and manage their infrastructure with the appropriate resources.

:::note
Our current billing system is based on Stripe, which is a secure and reliable payment gateway. We are working on adding more payment gateways in the future.

## Projects and billing

In the Fleek platform, Projects are central to the billing structure. The project is expected to provide or have customer-related details within Fleek, such as:

- Payment Methods
- Subscriptions

In the platform, each account manages multiple [projects](https://fleek.xyz/docs/platform/projects/).

## Plans

Plans define the pricing tiers that projects can be subscribed to. Each plan in the Fleek platform contains the respective offerings that differentiate them. Fleek helps with billing management per plan.

There are 2 plan tiers on Fleek:

1. **Free plan**: The free base plan for every project
2. **Pro plan**: The minimum price for a project to upgrade is $20

The pricing system supports multiple prices (for resources or add-ons), but only the Pro plan price is currently available. The features of each plan vary, but, a breakdown is as follows:

### Free plan

- Deploy in seconds
- A custom domain
- A member per project
- Maximum of 3 sites
- Fleek Functions
- Fleek storage
- Community support

### Pro plan

- Upgraded limits
- Additional custom domains
- Additional build tiers
- Intermediate support

For a thorough breakdown of the features of each plan, you can check out the [pricing page](/pricing).

## How to upgrade to the Pro plan

:::info
For the Enterprise plan, please contact Sales [here](https://fleek.typeform.com/fleekinterest?typeform-source=fleek.xyz).
:::

To upgrade to the Pro plan, follow these steps:

1. From your dashboard, navigate to the "Settings" page from your sidebar
2. On the "Settings" page, click on the "Billing" tab
3. Click on the "Upgrade to Pro" button. This redirects you to our payment portal, where you can complete the upgrade process
4. Fill in all the required details there and complete the payment process
5. You will then be redirected back to the "Billing" page on the Fleek platform, where you can see the updated plan details

On the "Billing" page, you will see your "Payment method" section updated with the payment details you provided during the upgrade process.
There will be three vertical dots on the right side of the payment method that you can click on to update the payment method details.

## Subscriptions

Subscriptions are the core component of the billing system. When a project upgrades to a paid plan, a subscription is initiated on Stripe.

Key Subscription Operations:

- **Subscription Creation**: A customer is created when a project subscribes to a plan, and a checkout session is initiated.
- **Subscription Updates**: Projects can upgrade or downgrade between plans. The system will cancel the current subscription and start a new one.
- **Cancellation**: Projects can cancel their subscription, which will remain active until the end of the billing period.
