# Billing

Fleek’s billing system provides a flexible and scalable solution for managing subscriptions, payments and billing cycles.
This enables users to control their project’s operations costs and manage their infrastructure with the appropriate resources.

:::note
Our current billing system is powered by Stripe, which is a secure and reliable payment gateway. We are working on adding more payment gateways in the future.

## Projects and billing

In the Fleek platform, projects are central to the billing structure. The project is expected to provide or have customer-related details within Fleek, such as:

- Payment methods
- Subscriptions

In the platform, each account manages multiple [projects](https://fleek.xyz/docs/platform/projects/).

## Plans

Plans define the pricing tiers that projects can be subscribed to. Each plan in the Fleek platform contains the respective offerings that differentiate them. Fleek helps with billing management per plan.

There are three plan tiers on Fleek:

1. **Free Plan**: A free plan those just starting out.
2. **Pro Plan**: $20 per month. Our most popular option for teams and growing projects.
3. **Enterprise Plan**: Starts at $1000/month. A custom plan for larger projects with custom needs.

The features of each plan vary, but, a breakdown is as follows:

### Free Plan

- Deploy in seconds
- A custom domain
- A member per project
- Maximum of 3 sites
- Fleek Functions
- Fleek Storage
- Community support

### Pro Plan

- Upgraded limits

## How to upgrade to the Pro Plan

To upgrade to the Pro Plan, follow these steps:

1. From your dashboard, navigate to the "Settings" page from your sidebar.
2. On the "Settings" page, click on the "Billing" tab.
3. Click on the "Upgrade to Pro" button. This redirects you to our payment portal, where you can complete the upgrade process.
4. Fill in all the required details there and complete the payment process.
5. You will then be redirected back to the "Billing" page on the Fleek platform, where you can see the updated plan details.

On the "Billing" page, you will see your "Payment method" section updated with the payment details you provided during the upgrade process.
There will be three vertical dots on the right side of the payment method that you can click on to update the payment method details.

## Subscriptions

Subscriptions are the core component of the billing system. When a project upgrades to a paid plan, a subscription is initiated on Stripe.

Key subscription operations:

- **Subscription creation**: A customer is created when a project subscribes to a plan and a checkout session is initiated.
- **Subscription updates**: Projects can upgrade or downgrade between plans. The system will cancel the current subscription and start a new one.
- **Cancellation**: Projects can cancel their subscription, which will remain active until the end of the billing period.
