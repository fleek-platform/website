# Git integrations with Fleek

Fleek allows for automatic deployment on push to your repository, and provides a variety of tools to manage your application from your preferred interface.
Updates pushed to the project-linked repository are automatically deployed through Fleek, and the triggers behind this can be controlled on a granular level through Fleek platform settings.

Fleek allows for automatic deployments on every branch push and merges onto the production branch of your GitHub projects.

Using Git with Fleek offers numerous benefits which includes:

- Automatic deployments on every branch push and merges onto the production branch of your GitHub projects.
- The ability to manage your deployments from an interface you are already familiar with. With insights on details and deployment logs.
- Settings for deployment like managing environment variables, custom domains, and more.

The supported provider for now is [GitHub](https://github.com/), but we are working on adding support for other Git providers in the future.

## Managing Git integrations

:::info
The Github application buttons have 3 states - "Install App", "Authorize App", and "Active".
:::

1. Go to your Fleek dashboard and click on the 'Settings' button at the top of the page.

2. Click on the 'Git Integrations' tab on the left sidebar.

3. Click on the "Install App" buttons. You will be redirected to Github to install and authorize the Fleek applications.

4. After authorizing the Fleek application, you will be redirected back to Fleek. The "Install App" button will now be replaced with an "Active" button.

That's it! You have successfully set up Git Integrations with Fleek. You can now manage your deployments from your Github repository within Fleek!

## Removing Git integrations

You may want to remove the Git integrations from your Fleek account. To do this, Go to your [Github profile settings](https://github.com/settings/profile) and click on the 'Applications' tab on the left sidebar, you will see a list with all your installed Github applications.
