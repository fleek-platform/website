# Fleek Edge SGX

:::warn
The Fleek Edge SGX service is still in alpha and not recommended yet to be be used in production.
:::

## What is Fleek Edge SGX?

Fleek's Edge SGX service is a decentralized, edge-optimized tool that provides secure compute capabilities using Intel's SGX Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). It allows developers to seamlessly integrate private, encrypted data processing into their applications without worrying about hardware or complex infrastructure management.

## Why Fleek Edge SGX?

Fleek Edge SGX is used to ensure that sensitive data remains encrypted and secure during processing, making it ideal for privacy-focused applications. It offers remote attestation for verified security, edge optimization for faster performance, and reduces development time, cost, and complexity by handling the infrastructure and scaling needs for developers.

:::info
The V0 alpha supports WASM, with future plans to add more languages.

## How to use Fleek Edge SGX

:::info
For a deep dive on how to use this service with Fleek, follow this guide [here](https://fleek.xyz/guides/getting-started-fleek-functions-edge-sgx/).
:::

Using Fleekâ€™s Edge SGX service is straightforward and similar to the process for our JavaScript service:

1. Install the [Fleek CLI](https://fleek.xyz/docs/cli/)

2. Run this command to auth your CLI tool:

   ```bash
   fleek login
   ```

3. Run this command to deploy:

   ```bash
   fleek functions deploy --name Myfunction --path my.wasm --sgx
   ```

4. You can invoke this function at https://fleek-test.network/services/3 with a payload containing hash, inputs, and whether its encrypted or not (always yes with the current tool), and any inputs you need:
   ```bash
   curl fleek-test.network/services/3 --data '{"hash": "<hash>", "decrypt": true}'
   ```

This makes an IPFS request and runs tasks that will then give us a response with the data as a string and a stringified object with some information like the signature and more. We have an example response below that shows what the reponse looks like:

```bash
{"hash":"eac455244d7970f5428070c1f28d144c2e5033689de98b1b826b5b4eb6a38a14","tree":"eac455244d7970f5428070c1f28d144c2e5033689de98b1b826b5b4eb6a38a14","signature":"3cf56fe96dcbd1e77c77e6867958a8d8e22cac3c310f1670288403950840f53109e26ef284db7edc3453b316e6d20fb2cf5873f601d96e5badc6e88d3d4b5f0201"}
Hello, world! From, SGX WASM <3
```
