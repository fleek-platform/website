## Fleek Network

Fleek Network is lightning-fast on-chain cloud infrastructure that provides highly-performant, edge-optimized cloud and Web services.

It enables developers to work with a high-performance, permissionless, self-sovereign and open-source system requiring no DevOps and at very low cost. This enables developers to spend more time with their codebase and less time on the management of their application.
