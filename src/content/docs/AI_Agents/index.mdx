# AI Agents ðŸ¤–

AI agents are autonomous systems designed to perform tasks or make decisions based on their programming, learned knowledge, or input data. They can interact with their environment, analyze situations, and execute actions to achieve specific goals. AI agents often use machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and other AI techniques to carry out their tasks effectively.

## Types of AI Agents

## Reactive Agents

These agents operate only based on current inputs without memory or learning.
\
_Example:_ A chatbot that responds to queries based on predefined rules.

# Deliberative Agents

These agents use a model of the environment to plan and reason about future actions.
\
_Example:_ A navigation system that calculates the best route using current and predicted traffic.

# Learning Agents

These agents improve their performance over time by learning from interactions and feedback.
\
_Example:_ An AI that optimizes video recommendations based on user behavior.

# Multi-Agent Systems

Multi-Agent systems are a collection of AI agents working collaboratively or competitively to achieve complex tasks.
\
_Example:_ Autonomous drones coordinating to map a disaster zone.
