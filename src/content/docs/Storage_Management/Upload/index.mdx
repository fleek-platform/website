<TabItem title="CLI">
### Add a file or directory

Add file via Fleek Storage to ipfs and backup on filecoin or arweave or both

To add a file to Fleek Storage run the command:

```sh
fleek storage add <PATH>
```

For example, let's say that you have a file "~/MyFiles/hello_world.txt", that contains the following:

```sh
Hello World!
```

To upload the file to Fleek Platform Storage service, you'd run the command **storage**:

```sh
fleek storage \
  add ~/MyFiles/hello_world.txt
```

```sh
Upload Progress [â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ] 100% | ETA: 0s
```

Once complete, you'll get a confirmation message, including a gateway URL to access the content of the file:

```sh
âœ… Success! The Storage IPFS CID is <CID>

> You can access it through your private gateway
ðŸ”— https://flk-ipfs.xyz/ipfs/<CID>
```
