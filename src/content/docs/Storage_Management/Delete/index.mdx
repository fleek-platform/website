## Delete a File or a Directory

Learn how to delete files or directories to Fleek using the Platform or the CLI.

<Tabs>
<TabItem title="Platform">

1. Locate the file or directory in the Files section.
2. Click on the three-dot icon in the row of the file or directory.
3. Select the Delete option. This will remove the file or directory from your storage. Note: This action is irreversible.

</TabItem>

<TabItem title="CLI">

Delete files and directories in Fleek Storage either by Name or CID.

Use the flag --cid to delete a file by its CID.

```sh
fleek storage \
  get --cid <CID>
```

Use the flag --name to delete a file by its Name.

```sh
fleek storage \
  get --name <FILENAME>
```

For example, let's say that we'd like to delete the file of the pseudo CID xyz:

```sh
fleek storage \
  delete --cid xyz
```

You'll get the action status and a delete confirmation message, if the request is fully processed.

```sh
> Processing cid: baf...kup
âœ… Success! The cid: baf...kup has been successfully deleted.
```
