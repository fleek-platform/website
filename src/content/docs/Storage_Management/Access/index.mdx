## List your Fleek Functions

## Accessing a file or directory

1. Locate the file or directory in the Files section.
2. Click on the three-dot icon in the row corresponding to the file or directory.
3. Select the Copy URL option. This will copy the URL to your clipboard, enabling you to access the file or directory via IPFS gateways.
4. Optionally, you can set up a custom domain for a more performant and branded experience by following the steps in the [Gateways](/docs/cli/gateways/) section of the documentation.

## Content addressing

All files stored on Fleek are content-addressable using IPFS. Each file will receive a unique, immutable IPFS content hash, making it addressable in a standard web3 format.

- Example IPFS hash: QmX4XRaPP6jBSDiYr3tK7fEBWSA5QURS8WZ87ZvPRJgAqK
- Files can be accessed through Fleek's gateways or a public gateway like `ipfs.io/ipfs/<yourhash>`.

For dynamically changing content, you can use IPNS to map dynamic IPFS hashes to a static record. See the [CLI](/docs/cli) or [SDK](/docs/sdk/) sections for more information on managing IPNS records.

<TabItem title="CLI">

The **list** command gives the user a list of files or directories in the Fleek Storage for the current project.

To view the table run the command:

```sh
fleek storage list
```

You should get table similar to:

```sh
filename            cid        filecoin id      arweave id      link
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
hello-world.txt     baf...x3a  -                -               https://<CID>.ipfs.cf-ipfs.com
hello-world.txt     baf...kia  -                -               https://<CID>.ipfs.cf-ipfs.com
john-coltrane.mp3   baf...yu2  -                -               https://<CID>.custom-domain.xyz
```

## Get a storage file

You can retrieve files or directories from Fleek Storage by providing a Name or a CID. Use the list table to identify the files you are interested in.

:::note
Currently, the data isn't downloaded, a table is presented instead. For single files, you can lookup for the content URL and use cURL and pipe to a local file.

```sh
curl https://<CID>.ipfs.flk-ipfs.xyz > hello-world.txt
```

:::

Use the flag --cid to retrieve a file by its CID.

```sh
fleek storage \
  get --cid <CID>
```

Use the flag --name to retrieve a file by its Name.

```sh
fleek storage \
  get --name <FILENAME>
```

For example, let's say that we'd like to retrieve the file of the pseudo CID xyz:

```sh
fleek storage \
  get --cid xyz
```

You should get table similar to:

```sh
filename            cid        filecoin id      arweave id      link
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
john-coltrane.mp3   baf...yu2  -                -               https://<CID>.custom-domain.xyz
```
