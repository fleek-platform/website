# Agent logs on Fleek

Agent logs are an important feature for hosting an AI agent on Fleek, providing users with a transparent view of their AI agent’s actions.
This explains how agent logs work and why they are essential for optimizing and managing your AI agents effectively.

## Overview

Agent logs are detailed records of an AI agent’s actions, capturing every step of the agent’s journey from start to finish. These logs allow users to:

- Monitor agent behavior in real-time or retrospectively.
- Debug issues and identify errors quickly.
- Gain insights into agent performance to optimize future deployments.

Agent logs on Fleek provide the following key information:

- **Timestamp**: The exact time each action occurred.
- **Event**: A descriptive label for the action (e.g., "[◎ Already responded to tweet 1879911913624404225, skipping"]”).
- **Details**: Additional context about the event, such as input data or configuration details.
- **Status**: The result of the action, such as "success" or "error," with error messages if applicable.

2. Go to the “Agents” tab on the sidebar
3. Select your deployed AI agent.
