# Deploy AI agents

Fleek has released one-click deployments for autonomous AI agents. This will allow developers to simply focus on the agent's personality traits and trustlessly deploy AI agents on Fleek. With support for Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and remote attestations, Fleek ensures that the execution of AI agents is both secure and verifiable.
