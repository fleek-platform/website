# Model Providers

:::info
Fleek currently runs version the latest stable release of the Eliza framework -- [Version 0.18](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/releases).
:::

In the Eliza framework, "Models" refer to the various types of AI models that can be utilized to create and manage autonomous agents. These models define the behavior, personality, and capabilities of the agents, allowing them to interact intelligently in different environments.

Key features of models:

- **Type Aliases**: Models serve as templates for creating specific instances of agents with defined characteristics.

- **Flexibility**: Users can integrate and customize models to meet specific application needs.

- **Interaction**: Models ensure consistent agent personalities and knowledge across platforms.

- **Extensibility**: Developers can extend existing models or create new ones for evolving requirements.

Eliza provides a wide range of model providers, each with their own secrets and configurations. Some popular model providers include:

By leveraging these models, Eliza facilitates the development of sophisticated AI agents capable of performing tasks ranging from simple interactions to complex decision-making processes.

        }
        ...
    }
    ...
}
