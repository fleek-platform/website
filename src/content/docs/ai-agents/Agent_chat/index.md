# Agent Chat Feature

Fleek now supports **real-time AI agent chat**, enabling users to interact with their deployed agents directly from the Eliza deployment platform. This feature allows the testing of AI agent interactions, ensuring smooth functionality of the agent after deployment.

## Overview

The **Agent Chat Feature** is designed to provide a real-time conversational interface between users and their AI agents. This eliminates the need for external testing environments, allowing developers and users to refine their agents' behavior directly within the Fleek ecosystem. Whether you’re testing responses, or simply interacting with your agent, this feature offers a seamless experience.

## Key Features

- **Instant communication**: Engage in real-time conversations with AI agents.
- **Multi-agent support**: Switch between different deployed AI agents within the platform.
- **Easy-to-use interface**: Simple chat UI within the Fleek dashboard for smooth interaction.

## How to Chat with Your AI Agent

4. **Test and Debug Responses**

   - Use the chat to assess how well your agent processes inputs and formulates replies.
   - Adjust the agent’s behavior or fine-tune its responses by modifying its characterfile or model settings.

5. **View and Manage Conversation History**

   - Past messages will remain visible within the session, allowing you to analyze response trends.
   - If needed, reset or clear the chat history to start fresh testing.
