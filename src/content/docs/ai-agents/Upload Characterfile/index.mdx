## Uploading a characterfile

Your AI agent is now ready to interact seamlessly with external services.

## How to handle secrets

When uploading a characterfile, you may need to provide sensitive information such as API keys or other credentials.
The recommended way to do this is to include it in the "settings" key of your characterfile like so:

```json
{
   "name": "TestEliza",
    "clients": ["twitter"],
    "modelProvider": "openai",
    "settings": {
        "secrets": {
            "OPENAI_API_KEY": "myapikey",
            "TWITTER_DRY_RUN": "false",
            "TWITTER_USERNAME": "myTwitterUsername",
            "TWITTER_PASSWORD": "MyTwitterPasswords",
            "TWITTER_EMAIL": "myemail@gmail.com",
            "XAI_MODEL": "gpt-4o-mini"
        },
        "voice": { "model": "en_US-male-medium" }
    },
    ...
}
```
