## Create AI agent from template

If you’re looking for a quick way to get started, using a pre-built template is an excellent option.
Templates are pre-configured setups that you can customize to fit your needs.
Follow these steps to create an agent using a template:

1. Click on "Start with Template"
   From the [Get Started](http://fleek.xyz/eliza/) screen.

## Review AI agent details and deploy

You will be directed to a page to confirm your agent details. You can choose one of two ways to review your agent's details:

1. **As Text**. You can see an overview of all the agent's details in foldable sections. You will not be able to edit any of the details:

2. **As JSON**. You can see all the agent's details as they are in the characterfile you uploaded. You can edit the JSON directly:

Review the information provided and click 'Deploy agent'. Your AI agent will go live instantly and will be ready to interact with services.
