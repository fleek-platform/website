The agent layer is becoming real, and two major players are joining forces to accelerate its growth. Today, we’re excited to announce a strategic partnership between Venice AI and Fleek that connects infrastructure and intelligence at the foundation of a new internet.

This collaboration has two key pillars:

First, Venice is powering Fleek’s free trial. Every new user on Fleek will now receive $10 in free LLM usage, made possible through Venice. This means that whether you’re arriving from Fleek.xyz, partner platforms like auto.fun, or anywhere else, you can immediately start building and deploying agents without paying upfront for compute.

What makes this even more powerful is what Venice enables: unrestricted, uncensored LLMs across text, image, voice, and video. It removes the constraints of traditional AI providers and opens up possibilities that are much more aligned with the values of the Web3 ecosystem.

With Venice, Fleek users can tap into models that feel more autonomous, more expressive, and less filtered.

This is a huge unlock for the creator and builder communities using Fleek.

These are agents that feel human, not corporate. They can write, speak, draw, and even produce content on behalf of their owners - without needing to tiptoe around blacklisted phrases or restricted intent.

Even more important: it’s sustainable.

Venice offers token-based access to inference. That means you can stake VVV and access their LLMs without needing to pay a subscription. Similarly, Fleek will offer token-based access to its own infrastructure services. If you stake both VVV and FLK, your agents can run autonomously with no monthly bill. It’s a step toward truly decentralized, self-sustaining software.

Second, Fleek is powering Venice’s next product leap. Venice is already known for its AI-generated characters, used by over 300,000 people. Now, 25 percent of those users will be able to enhance their experience with advanced AI capabilities—thanks to Fleek’s infrastructure.

This means Venice users will benefit from more powerful AI-driven interactions, with enhanced capabilities supported by Fleek’s infrastructure. Fleek’s agent system and TEE-based infrastructure will be used under the hood to make it happen.

In practical terms, Fleek will become the invisible backend behind Venice agents. Every time a user engages with advanced AI features, such as launching behavior systems or initiating complex interactions, that logic will be running on Fleek. It’s a true infrastructure integration - not a superficial collaboration.

Together, these two moves create a full pipeline: Venice provides the intelligence layer, Fleek provides the runtime. Venice gives creators new forms of expression, Fleek gives them a place to deploy. Venice’s community gets to level up their creations, and Fleek’s platform becomes the easiest place to launch, run, and scale agents - now with built-in intelligence and compute included.

This partnership is about more than integrations. It’s about creating the conditions for agents to thrive.

When the frontend fades away and software starts acting on its own, the question becomes: what are the new primitives? What does the infrastructure stack for persistent, autonomous software actually look like?

We believe it looks like this:

- Agents that are private by default, verifiable by design
- Models that can be permissionless, expressive, and aligned with user values
- Infrastructure that scales through tokenized access, not corporate billing
- A runtime that isn’t hidden behind dashboards, but fully observable

Launch an agent using the at [fleek.xyz](https://fleek.xyz/)And join the movement that’s replacing the app layer.

And it’s already live.
