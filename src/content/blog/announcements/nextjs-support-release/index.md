Today, we're excited to launch support for fullstack **Next.js apps and sites** on Fleek! With this release, developers can now effortlessly deploy apps and experience **server-side rendering (SSR)** and **static site generation (SSG)** functionality directly within Fleek's edge-optimized platform, unlocking unparalleled scalability, performance, and control.

## **Why Next.js on Fleek?**

At Fleek, we‚Äôre committed to empowering developers with innovative tools that are reliable and cutting-edge. With our new [**Next.js support**](https://fleek.xyz/docs/cli/fleek-next-adapter/), deploying full-stack applications to Fleek has never been easier. Developers can now build apps and sites leveraging Fleek‚Äôs robust infrastructure coupled with Next.js‚Äôs powerful framework ‚Äî simplifying the developer experience while optimizing for performance and cost.

## **Key Features in This Release**

For this release, we‚Äôve focused on the core features that developers require to build and scale Next.js apps seamlessly on Fleek. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs available starting today:

- **App Router & Pages Router**: Full compatibility with Next.js's app and page routing systems ensures that applications of any size can run smoothly on Fleek‚Äôs edge network.
- **Route Handlers**: Define custom server-side route handlers for more flexibility in handling requests.
- **Dynamic Routes**: Create dynamic routes within your app, enabling personalized content and advanced routing logic.
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Pre-render pages at build time, optimizing load speeds and improving user experience.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Generate pages on request, ensuring content is always up-to-date without sacrificing performance.
- **Middleware**: Run code before a request is completed, allowing you to handle redirects, authorization, and more, at the edge.

## **How to Get Started**

Get started deploying a Next.js application on Fleek with the `**fleek-next` CLI\*\* tool. Here are the steps to get your app or site up and running:

1. **Install the [Fleek CLI](https://fleek.xyz/docs/cli/)**: Install the `fleek-next` package, a tailored CLI tool optimized for Fleek‚Äôs infrastructure. Simply run `npm i @fleek-platform/next` on your terminal.
2. **Set Your Edge Runtime**: In your server-side code, set `export const runtime = 'edge';` to ensure compatibility with Fleek‚Äôs edge network.
3. **Build**: Use `fleek-next build` to build your application. If you‚Äôre working outside your project‚Äôs root directory, simply add the `-p` or `--projectPath` flag to specify your file path.
4. **Deploy**: Finally deploy your application using `fleek functions deploy --bundle=false --path .fleek/dist/index.js --assets .fleek/static`. This command will prompt you to add the function name, so ensure that you run `fleek functions create -‚Äìname <function-name>` beforehand.

For more details, check out the [Getting Started Guide](https://fleek.xyz/docs/cli/fleek-next-adapter/), [GitHub](https://github.com/fleek-tools/fleek-nextjs-boilerplate), or [Docs](https://fleek.xyz/docs/platform/frameworks/), or try the setup via [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fleek-platform/next).

## **Looking Ahead**

And this is just the beginning. Our **Phase 2 release** will bring even more power to Next.js apps on Fleek, including **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**, **Image Optimization**, **Streaming Support**, and more.

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs coming:

- **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**: Imagine the best of both worlds‚Äîhigh-speed static performance with real-time updates. ISR will allow your app to serve pre-rendered pages lightning-fast while staying fresh with the latest data on demand. No more full rebuilds; just seamless updates exactly when and where you need them.
- **Image Optimization**: Fully optimized images, served at edge speed. Next.js on Fleek will handle image resizing, compression, and format conversion automatically, so your media-heavy apps load faster and look sharper. This means smoother UX and a boost in site performance across devices‚Äîyour users will love it.
- **Streaming Support**: With Streaming, Fleek takes your app‚Äôs interactivity to a new level, sending content to users as it‚Äôs generated. This opens the door to interactive experiences that load fast and keep audiences engaged, even with complex or data-rich applications.
- **Lazy Loading, Caching & More**: Performance is a non-negotiable, and Fleek is working on bringing you even more control with fine-tuned caching strategies, lazy loading for route handlers enabling optimized page loads, and advanced edge configurations. These optimizations mean users won‚Äôt just experience your app‚Äîthey‚Äôll be _immersed_ in it.
