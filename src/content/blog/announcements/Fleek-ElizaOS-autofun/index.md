Crypto is evolving fast, but the way projects launch hasn’t changed much. Today you either get a speculative meme launch with a high chance of getting rugged, or a VC-backed launch with a low float/high FDV with a strong chance of getting dumped on. Both models are broken—and token buyers have been paying the price.

That's why Fleek is excited to be powering the new auto.fun platform from the Eliza (fka ai16z) team —it’s a fresh take on token and AI agent launches and launchpads, with a strong focus and emphasis on improving the status quo.

- **Eliza** is building the open source framework and OS for AI agents
- **auto.fun** is the Eliza teams new launchpad for Eliza agents to come to life and launch a token in a more fair and sustainable way
- **Fleek** provides all the infrastructure to create and manage those AI agents on auto.fun, including the agent hosting, LLM keys, MCP servers, and more.

**Getting auto.fun to market 10x faster and 70% cheaper with Fleek**

Fleek was able to help the Eliza and auto.fun team get their new launchpad to market 10x faster and 70% cheaper than if they were to have built out all the agent infrastructure themselves. And that is exactly where Fleek’s AI agent platform is able to provide significant value to projects like auto.fun. Which is that rather than build out all the infrastructure yourself to create AI agents and agentic products, using Fleek can prove to be a much better, faster, and cheaper option.

Fleek offers the following products, features, and advantages both via platform and API that make it an extremely compelling option for projects building AI agents and agentic platforms and products:

**Agent Hosting**

Host agents standard or in TEEs. One click deploy. No server management or devops.

**LLM Key Provisioning** Choose whatever LLM you want, or use multiple LLMs for your use case (text, speech, image generation, etc.). Fleek automatically provides the keys for you and combines everything into one bill.

**MCP Servers & Plugins**

Add as many MCP servers and plugins to your agent as you want. Add them at initial creation or at any time afterwards to enhance your agent's skills and capabilities.

**Everything You Need In One Place (and one bill)**

All the infrastructure, integrations, and features you need in one unified platform, API, and bill. No more fragmenting across multiple vendors.

**One Click Verifiability & Privacy**: Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) power private and verifiable workloads, perfect for a growing number of agentic use cases.

**No Restrictions**: Leveraging open source and unrestricted LLM’s like Venice.ai, users have more flexibility and freedom to explore a wider range of agentic use cases.

**Vibe Creating Agents**

Conversationally build and update agents with natural language. Describe what you want and go from idea to agent in seconds.

**Developer & Consumer Friendly:** Fleek is easy enough for even non technical users to use. Anyone can launch, manage, and monetize AI agents with Fleek.

**The Fleek x Eliza x auto.fun integration makes AI agent launches fun & effortless.**

Fleek handles the deployment, hosting, and orchestration of the AI agents. Eliza provides the logic layer, auto.fun provides the launchpad. Together, they let anyone create an AI agent, fair launch a token, and start building momentum immediately. From the moment the token goes live, the agent is live too - tweeting, replying, gathering community, and onboarding new users.

This is already in motion. Dozens of AI-native projects are launching on auto.fun in the coming weeks, from FightFi and doglife.ai to CZAI, Comput3, and more. These aren’t hype tokens with vaporware promises. They’re real teams, building AI agents with actual utility and voice, bringing refreshed energy and life to the crypto x AI space.

There’s a deeper alignment here too. Eliza and Fleek both share a vision of agent-based software that is modular and autonomous. We think the future is agentic systems that reason, act, and evolve - on-chain, in public, and under the control of their creators.

That’s why this partnership will continue to grow and evolve.

Eliza helps define the agent logic, framework and OS. Fleek provides the infrastructure and platform to make it easy to create and manage the agents. Auto.fun becomes the place where the agents go to launch and activate their communities.

It’s not just a better launchpad. It’s a new standard for launching the next wave of crypto x AI projects, and we are proud to be involved.

The first wave is already live. And there’s a lot more coming.

AI Agent token launches will never look the same.
