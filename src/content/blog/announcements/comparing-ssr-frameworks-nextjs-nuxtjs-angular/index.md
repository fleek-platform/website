Server-side rendering (SSR) can enhance modern web performance, load times, and user experience for web apps and sites. Along with performance improvements, SSR simplifies web discoverability and can be beneficial in poor networking conditions. However, these compelling benefits come with technical challenges for developers.

Implementing SSR requires careful management of server resources, intricate handling of state between server and client, and complex deployment processes.

This is where SSR frameworks like Next.js, Nuxt.js, and Angular Universal come into play, simplifying the process of building and deploying SSR applications.

**_In this blog, we will explore the need for SSR frameworks, compare the three most popular SSR frameworks, and learn best practices for SSR development._**

## **Development complexities of server-side rendering**

Implementing server-side rendering (SSR) presents significant challenges due to architectural complexities arising from resource management and state synchronization between server and client. _Here are five common challenges faced by developers while implementing SSR from scratch_:

1. SSR can demand data fetching, which can increase server load and response times depending on implementation and optimization strategies.
2. Implementing isomorphic routing that works consistently on both the server and client sides is complex.
3. Deployment processes for SSR apps are more demanding, and often related to compatibility in managing code for both server and client.
4. Developers must manage synchronization of client and server states to ensure a seamless user experience.
5. Setting up caching strategies that bundle server and client code separately while maintaining shared code is challenging.

**_SSR frameworks typically abstract these challenges. But what exactly are SSR frameworks?_**

---

## **What are server-side rendering frameworks?**

**SSR frameworks are development tools designed to simplify the implementation of server-side rendering in web applications.**

These frameworks abstract away much of the complexity involved in SSR by providing pre-built solutions for handling common challenges like real-time data fetching, state management, and hydration (the process of synchronizing server-rendered HTML with client-side JavaScript).

The primary purpose of these frameworks is to allow developers to focus on building features rather than the infrastructure and boilerplate required for SSR.

At their core, SSR frameworks:

- Provide a unified codebase for server—and client-side rendering, allowing developers to write isomorphic code i.e. the JavaScript code that can run both on the client (browser) and the server (backend).
- Offer built-in routing solutions that work seamlessly across server and client, handling URL matching and navigation on both sides.
- Manage the hydration process, ensuring that server-rendered content is properly reconciled with client-side JavaScript for interactive functionality, If Javascript enabled in the browser..
- Include data fetching mechanisms that work efficiently on the server, with provisions for passing this data to the client for subsequent renders.
- Implement efficient build processes that bundle and optimize code for both server and client environments.
- Provide performance optimizations out-of-the-box, such as code splitting, lazy loading, and caching strategies.
- Offer server-side component rendering, allowing developers to create reusable UI components for faster initial page loads.

**_Simply put, SSR frameworks make the process of delivering fast, SEO-friendly content easier. Now, let’s explore the three popular SSR frameworks._**
