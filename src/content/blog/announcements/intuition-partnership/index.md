As virtual influencers go mainstream, trust becomes the core infrastructure problem.

Who created the character you’re chatting with?

Is it safe to interact with?

Has it been flagged, cloned, or misrepresented before?

In a world where digital personas can be spun up in seconds and reach millions in minutes, identity can no longer be optional. That’s why Fleek is partnering with [**Intuition**](https://www.intuition.systems/), the onchain protocol for decentralized identity and trust.

Starting soon, every virtual influencer created on Fleek will be issued an **onchain identity**, an “Atom” on Intuition’s global knowledge graph. This transforms each character from a social avatar into a verifiable, composable asset with provable authorship, attributes, and intent.

It’s the foundation for making digital personas real and trusted.

## **Onchain Identity, by Default**

Every time you spin up a character in Fleek Studio, it’s instantly registered as an **Atom** on Intuition. This is a user profile with a persistent, cryptographically verifiable record that says:

- This influencer was created by a known wallet
- It belongs to a specific creator account
- It was configured with a defined set of behaviors and purposes

Any app, dashboard, analytics layer, or brand can now read and verify that information in real time.

It’s like giving every influencer a passport for the internet, signed by the platform and traceable across ecosystems.

## **Rich Metadata You Can Trust**

The moment an influencer is created, its Atom begins accumulating structured, onchain metadata, things like:

- Intended audience
- Monetization status
- NSFW flags
- Engagement history
- Affiliated campaigns or brand partners

Each piece of metadata is a **claim**: a signed, cryptographic proof anchored onchain. Some are issued by the creator. Some are signed by Fleek. All are inspectable, immutable, and tamper-proof.

**Why this matters**: Instead of guessing from follower counts or polished bios, brands and users open the record and check the facts. They see when a character was made, who signed off, how it behaves, and whether the community praised or flagged it. They can confirm if the real creator endorsed a product or if a deepfake hijacked their likeness to push a knock-off. Fake followers, paid clicks, and bot farms become obvious, so marketing budgets and attention flow to genuine influence.

## **“Verified by Fleek” Cryptographic Trust**

Select creators and characters on Fleek will also receive an official **“Verified by Fleek”** attestation, written directly into their Intuition Atom and signed by Fleek’s wallet.

This is protocol-level truth: cryptographic proof that the character is approved by the Fleek platform, created under a verified configuration, and not spoofed, cloned, or faked.

For brands and users, it’s the ultimate trust signal.

And because it lives on Intuition’s graph, it’s portable and composable, usable by any app, platform, or marketplace building with Intuition.

## **Discovery as Reputation: Stake, Don’t Scroll**

Today’s discovery tools, stars, likes, follower counts, don’t scale. They’re easily gamed and don’t reflect real conviction.

With Intuition, we unlock a new model: **stake-weighted reputation.**

Soon, users will be able to stake value on influencers they believe in, surfacing the most credible and aligned personas, while rewarding early believers.

This flips the curation model on its head by rewarding not those who paid for views, but who earned belief.

And it gives the Fleek ecosystem a native way to rank and recommend influencers that actually aligns with user values and desires.

## **Infrastructure for the Influencer Economy**

Fleek x Intuition sets the groundwork for a radically different social layer, one that understands the new wave of creators, the rise of virtual personas, and the need for programmable, verifiable trust.

With this partnership:

- Creators can claim credit, prove ownership, and earn from their characters without fear of copycats or lost attribution.
- Brands can check a public record before paying, sending ad spend only to authentic voices with proven performance.
- Users know who built the character and how it behaves, so they can decide quickly whether to trust, follow, or ignore.

Virtual influence will now become a first-class economic layer, where identity, intent, and ownership are all embedded in the design from the beginning.

## **Coming Soon**

This integration is already underway.

Soon, Fleek Studio will roll out one-click registration with Intuition. Every new virtual influencer created on Fleek will automatically mint an Atom, with metadata and verification support built in.

We’re excited to help shape the future of influence, one that’s transparent, composable, and deeply trusted.

Stay tuned.
