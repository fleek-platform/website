_Embedded agents, credits, managed LLMs and conversational creation on the way_

The agent economy is heating up and we’re building the rails for it.

This week, we’re shipping updates that make it easier to launch, customize, and scale agents with Fleek. From simple embeds to crypto-native billing, here’s what’s live and what’s just around the corner.

## Live Now

### Drop your agent into any site

Your agent doesn’t have to live in a dashboard anymore.

You can now embed it as a floating chat widget on your website. Go to **Settings → Share**, copy the snippet, and drop it into your site. That’s it.

Now your users can chat with your agent, wherever they already are.

### Credits are live (fiat + crypto)

We’ve added a credit system to give you more control over billing.

1 credit = $1. Top up with a credit card or USDC. Everything is managed right from your dashboard.

Use credits to cover:

- Subscriptions
- LLM calls
- More features soon

_You can view and manage your balance directly in your dashboard or from the Account Settings page._

**Native crypto payments**

You can now pay for your agent with crypto, directly through the credits system.

No third-party plugins. Just connect your wallet, top up with USDC, and let your credits handle the rest.

_Right now, crypto payments are supported for agent subscriptions. Hosting support is coming soon._

## Coming Soon

### Managed LLMs

Forget juggling API keys.

You’ll soon be able to select OpenAI, Claude, or others directly in Fleek with no setup needed. We’ll handle the infra, rate limits, and billing. You just build.

### Conversational agent creation

We’re making agent creation feel like chatting with a friend.

Instead of filling out forms, you’ll describe your agent in natural language and watch it take shape in real time.

No code. No config. Just an idea to live agent in minutes.
