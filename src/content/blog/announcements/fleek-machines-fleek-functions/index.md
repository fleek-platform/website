# Sign up today for early access to Fleek Machines

Fleek is excited to introduce the next iteration of our expanding TEE (trusted execution environment) capabilities: **Fleek Machines**. Fleek Machines are lightweight TEE VMs with docker support that offer builders a seamless way to leverage long-running (TEEs) for verifiable and/or confidential computing use cases.

Starting today, builders can request early access to Fleek Machines [here](https://fleek.typeform.com/machinesaccess).

Why Fleek Machines?

Hereâ€™s why builders should be excited about Fleek Machines:

- **One-Click Verified and Confidential Compute**: Eliminate setup complexity. Simply deploy your Docker image, and Fleek Machines handles the rest.
- **Docker Support**: Run anything in a TEE that you can run in Docker, making integration seamless.
- **No DevOps or Hardware Instantiation**: Focus on your code instead of infrastructure. No more complex hardware or operational overhead.
- **Framework & Chain Agnostic**: Fleek Machines work with all Web2 and Web3 frameworks, languages and protocols, making them a great fit for a variety of use cases.
- **Remote Attestation & Reproducible Builds:** Verify execution with cryptographic proofs. Option to disable reproducible builds (useful for certain privacy use cases)
- **Reduced Time to Market & Costs:** A faster and more affordable alternative to traditional TEE infrastructure options.
- **Unstoppable (Future):** Plans to integrate into Fleek Network for enhanced performance (global edge deployments, geo-routing, redundancy) and security (trustless, permissionless, censorship-resistant, open source) in future updates.

## Real use cases

Fleek Machines are already being tested by early adopters for different applications and use cases. Here are a few examples of some of the things builders are exploring:

**1. AI Agent Hosting, Orchestration, & Processing**

Whether you are creating chatbots, orchestrating a swarm of agents, building recommendation systems or automation tools, Fleek Machines deliver the devex, performance and integrity needed for AI-driven applications and use cases.

**2. Privacy-Focused Consumer Experiences**

Develop interactive privacy-focused consumer experiences where user trust is paramount. Fleek Machines enable secure processing of user data, meeting privacy and compliance requirements without sacrificing speed or performance.

**3. TEE Co-Processor**

Anything thatâ€™s too expensive to do onchain or too expensive for zk-proofs you could do in Fleek Machines and submit proof onchain (MEV, sequencing, rollup infra, oracles, heavy compute, etc.).

**4. Compliance for Fintech and Regulated Industries**

Fleek Machines simplify private computation with cryptographic proofs and verifiable execution. This makes it easier to meet compliance and regulatory standards (ex. GDPR) while maintaining scalability and performance.

The above examples are just the start. Fleek Machines are opening up new possibilities for verified and/or confidential compute use cases across industries and weâ€™re inviting developers to be part of this journey.
