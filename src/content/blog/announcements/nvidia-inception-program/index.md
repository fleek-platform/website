The next generation of software won’t live in dashboards or app stores. It will run as agents that work 24/7 for users and organizations. The same way the web needed cloud infrastructure to scale, agents need a new kind of compute layer.

That’s why today, we’re excited to share that Fleek has joined the [NVIDIA Inception Program](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/startups/), a global initiative supporting startups building next-generation AI and data science applications.

This partnership connects two core pieces of the new internet: Fleek’s decentralized infrastructure for autonomous agents, and NVIDIA’s high-performance hardware and software ecosystem for AI.

Together, we’re building a faster and more scalable foundation for agents to run anywhere.

### Why NVIDIA, and Why Now

As agents become more intelligent and widely adopted, their compute requirements grow. Running an agent isn’t like serving a website. It means real-time inference, onchain decision-making, and continuous execution. These workloads require serious performance, and performance demands GPUs.

NVIDIA’s tools, from the DGX server lineup to the NVIDIA AI Enterprise stack, offer the hardware and tools needed to deploy AI at scale. By joining the NVIDIA Inception Program, Fleek gets direct access to GPU infrastructure and technical support across decentralized compute and secure environments.

This isn’t about chasing compute for its own sake. It’s about powering a new kind of software: systems that reason, coordinate, transact, and evolve.

### What This Unlocks for Fleek

Fleek’s mission is to make it dead simple to deploy and run AI agents. We do that through an agent-native cloud platform - one that abstracts away backend complexity, scales on demand, and integrates privacy, verifiability, and multichain logic by default.

But performance is table stakes. That’s where NVIDIA comes in.

As part of Inception, we’ll be working closely with NVIDIA to:

- Benchmark and optimize LLM inference pipelines
- Accelerate agent runtimes using GPU-powered TEEs and MCP servers
- Expand our agent orchestration framework to support larger and more complex use cases
- Explore collaboration on verifiable compute for mission-critical and privacy-sensitive workflows

This means faster agents. Smarter logic. Lower latency. And the ability to scale from one user to one million without rebuilding infrastructure from scratch.

We’re also excited to co-market Fleek’s stack with NVIDIA’s support - helping more developers, researchers, and organizations discover what’s possible when you bring agent logic to the edge of the internet.

### Building the Agent Layer with the Best in AI

Joining the NVIDIA Inception Program isn’t a pivot. It’s a multiplier.

Fleek is already powering hundreds of autonomous agents across verticals like DeFi, social, productivity, customer experience, and content creation. Our platform integrates LLMs, plugin systems, privacy-preserving compute, and multichain execution under one roof - with no need to manage infra or APIs.

What NVIDIA brings is the muscle - the ability to go bigger, faster, and deeper into enterprise-grade AI.

And that matters, because the agent layer is no longer theoretical. It’s live, it’s scaling, and it’s going to shape the way the next decade of software looks and feels.

### What’s Next

This partnership marks a key milestone in Fleek’s journey - and it comes at the perfect moment. As we prepare for our upcoming token launch on CoinList and roll out major features like conversational agent creation, credit-based crypto billing, and managed LLM access, NVIDIA’s support will help us go further, faster.

We're not just building tools. We're building the future of autonomous systems - and with NVIDIA in our corner, that future is getting a lot more powerful.

Stay tuned as we share what we’re building next. The agent layer isn’t coming. It’s already here - and now it runs on GPUs.

Deploy an agent today on [fleek.xyz](https://fleek.xyz/)And follow our journey as we scale into the AI future.
