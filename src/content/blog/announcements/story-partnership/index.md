## The Next Layer Needs New Rights

Agents are changing how content gets generated and who owns the rights and value it generates. That’s why we’re excited to announce our partnership with Story bringing native IP support this shift.

Soon, creators using Fleek can license, track, and monetize everything their agents produce, including the agents and virtual influencers themselves, with provenance, attribution, and programmable ownership baked in.

Whether you’re minting a virtual influencer’s content as NFTs, remixing licensed clips from Story’s catalog, or building a fan-driven media agent this partnership gives you a way to do it legally, onchain, and without middlemen.

## Why This Matters

Content is being generated faster than ever by users, by AI tools, and by agents. And in a world where anyone (or anything) can make something, authorship and ownership gets fuzzy.

- Who owns a viral tweet, the user or their agent?
- What about an image remixed from five sources?
- Can an agent license something it created and enforce that license?

These are the kind of things that are going to break everything if we don’t build the right infrastructure now.

That’s what Story makes possible a way to treat creative work, even when it’s generated by agents, like something people can actually own, license, and track from the start. It also means remixing doesn’t have to be a legal minefield. Story lets agents pull from pre-licensed content with attribution and usage terms carried forward, so creators know they’re covered even when remixing at scale.

## What Story Unlocks

Story is building onchain infrastructure for IP tools to register, license, remix, and monetize IP assets at the protocol level.

Through our partnership, Fleek-powered agents will be able to:

**Register every output as IP**

Turn text, images, and media generated by agents into registered, onchain assets.

**License outputs automatically**

Choose your model CC0, attribution-required, or something custom. Agents can be configured to publish under specific terms, by default.

**Track remix chains and attribution**

As content evolves, lineage and ownership persist even across agents and platforms.

**Monetize at the protocol level**

Licensing, royalties, and composable rights flow through the same rails.

Owning what you create is hard. This makes it easier and built to scale

## One-Click IP Registration Flow Launching Ahead of Story Hackathon

To support builders participating in the upcoming Story Hackathon, we will be launching a one-click IP registration flow with Fleek. Meaning creators can seamlessly register an agent or its outputs with Story, no extra setup needed.

This will make it easier than ever to:

- Register virtual influencers and autonomous agents as IP
- Establish authorship and rights from the moment of creation
- **Tap into royalty and licensing flows out of the box**

All hosted through Fleek’s decentralized infrastructure, fast, censorship-resistant, and ready to scale with you.

**A Composable Stack for the Next Creative Economy**

Together, Fleek and Story will offer:

- Autonomous agents that act and publish on your behalf
- Infrastructure to deploy, scale, and manage agents privately and verifiably
- Tools to protect every piece of content from the moment it's created
- A framework for onchain IP that persists wherever the content travels

It’s the beginning of a new creator stack where every meme, model, or remix has a digital fingerprint, and creators own the assets their agents generate.

## Let’s Build It Together

This is what agents need to thrive:

Infrastructure that treats creative output as programmable, ownable, and composable.
