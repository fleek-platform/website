### The End of the Interface

For decades, software innovation has centered around interface. From the rise of the GUI to the explosion of mobile apps, progress has meant designing better frontends - faster, smoother, more intuitive ways for humans to interact with machines.

But now, something bigger is happening. The most powerful software of the next decade won’t wait for user input. It’ll act on your behalf.

Autonomous agents - software that can observe, reason, and take action - are poised to reshape how we interact with the internet. These systems don’t live in app stores. They don’t rely on dashboards or frontends. And they don’t sit idle waiting for clicks.

They run continuously. They make decisions, manage resources, coordinate with protocols, and execute logic - all without asking for permission.

This is what we call the agent layer: a new category of software that moves from reactive to proactive. And we believe it’s going to be bigger than the app layer ever was.

But there’s one catch: the infrastructure we’ve built over the past 20 years isn’t ready for this shift.

That’s why this isn’t just about UX. It’s about architecture. And it’s why we built Fleek.

### A Short History of Interface as Power

Software has always advanced in lockstep with its accessibility.

The command line gave birth to control - for the few who could use it. Then came graphical interfaces, opening computing to the world. The browser made software reachable through hyperlinks. Mobile turned that reach into obsession. The app became the new container for logic, branding, and behavior.

Crypto tried to rewrite this. But we mostly replicated the model. We built dashboards, dApps, and wallets - apps with a new backend.

Apps made digital experiences easy. But they are still passive. They wait.

And now, that’s not enough.

###  Agents: The Next Interface Layer

Agents don’t wait. They move.

Autonomous agents are software entities that pursue goals, not instructions. They run logic on behalf of users - calling APIs, signing transactions, scheduling actions, and engaging with systems across the web.

They collapse the need for manual input. They don’t need screens. They’re not bound to a UI. And they don’t care if someone’s watching.

In fact, their power comes from that independence.

We’ve already built the ingredients:

- APIs are programmable
- LLMs enable reasoning- 
- On-chain logic allows economic coordination
- TEEs enable verifiability and privacy

Now it’s time to connect those pieces. That’s what the agent layer is.

And it won’t run on app infrastructure.

### Why Apps Can’t Support the Agent Layer

Apps follow a familiar pattern: input → render → result.

But agents don’t operate in sessions. They exist over time.

They require state, not just storage. Memory, not just caching. Logs, metrics, orchestration. They act continuously - not in response to clicks, but in pursuit of intent.

The infrastructure needed to support them doesn’t exist in your average stack. AWS isn’t optimized for verifiable compute. Dashboards can’t manage multi-agent coordination. Web2 billing doesn’t account for usage-based compute or LLM calls.

Even in crypto, we’re stuck in the interface era - building DeFi dashboards while ignoring what lives underneath.

### What the Agent Layer Needs

To make the agent layer real, we need more than prompts and wrappers.

We need:

- One-click deploys with no backend setup
- Verifiable compute (TEE or ZK)
- Built-in access to LLMs and plugin ecosystems
- Billing based on usage, not flat fees
- Logs, observability, and memory
- Composability across agents, APIs, and chains

It’s not just about running agents - it’s about giving them a native home.

Right now, that doesn’t exist in one place.

So we built it.

## #Why Fleek Exists

Fleek is the infrastructure layer for autonomous agents.

It’s not an OpenAI wrapper. It’s not a frontend SDK. It’s a full-stack runtime built to deploy, host, and scale agents - with the speed, flexibility, and privacy they demand.

With Fleek, you can:

- Deploy an agent in under 30 seconds
- Choose between standard or TEE hosting
- Use our built-in LLM key management
- Pay only for what you use
- Embed agents anywhere via chat widget
- Track every action with full logs and usage dashboards

The agent layer needs its own cloud.

Fleek is building it.

### What This Changes

The shift from apps to agents is not incremental. It’s fundamental.

Apps are interfaces. Agents are systems.
Apps ask for permission. Agents act with intent.
Apps are walled gardens. Agents move across the internet.

This won’t be a nice-to-have. It will be the default way the most useful software runs.

And the people who control that layer - the infrastructure, the logic, the orchestration - will control the next era of the web.

We don’t believe agents are a feature.
We believe they’re the future.
