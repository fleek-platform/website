Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the backbone of innovation across industries. But even the most advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) like Claude, ChatGPT or DeepSeek hit a wall when it comes to accessing real-time data or interacting with external tools. Enter the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, an open-source standard from Anthropic that’s rewriting the rules of AI integration. Imagine a universal adapter that connects your AI assistant to everything from Google Drive to GitHub with a single, elegant protocol. That’s MCP and it’s here to change how we build smarter, context-aware AI systems.

In the following we’ll explore what MCP is, why it’s a big deal, how it works, and why builders should care. Whether you’re a developer, a tech enthusiast, or a business leader, this guide will show you how MCP could be the key to unlocking AI’s full potential.

## What is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

Launched by Anthropic in November 2024, the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard designed to bridge the gap between AI models and external data sources. Think of it as a universal translator for LLMs, allowing them to seamlessly connect with tools, databases, and platforms without the headache of custom integrations. Before MCP, integrating an AI assistant with, say, Slack or a PostgreSQL database meant building a bespoke solution from scratch which is time-consuming, costly, and unscalable.

MCP changes the game by offering a standardized framework. It’s like the USB-C of AI: one protocol to rule them all. With pre-built connectors for popular systems like Google Drive, GitHub, and Slack (and more on the way), MCP empowers AI to fetch real-time data, execute tasks, and deliver hyper-relevant responses all through a single, secure interface.

## Why MCP Matters: Solving AI’s Context Conundrum

AI models are incredibly smart, but they’re often stuck in a bubble. Without access to external data, their responses can feel generic or outdated. For example, imagine asking your AI assistant to summarize your latest GitHub commits or analyze a Slack thread. Without a way to connect to those platforms, it’s just guessing or worse, failing.

This is where MCP shines. It tackles three critical challenges:

1. **Fragmented Integrations**: No more one-off coding for every new data source. MCP standardizes the process, saving developers time and effort.
2. **Contextual Relevance**: By pulling in real-time data, MCP makes AI responses more accurate and tailored to your needs.
3. **Scalability**: As your AI use case grows, MCP adapts effortlessly, connecting to new tools without reinventing the wheel.

Early adopters like **Sourcegraph**, **Replit**, and **Apollo** are already leveraging MCP to supercharge their platforms. For instance, Sourcegraph’s Cody uses MCP to pull in database schemas or GitHub issues directly into your editor. It’s a glimpse of the future and it’s happening now.

## How Does MCP Work? A Peek Under the Hood

MCP operates on a simple yet powerful client-server architecture. Here’s the breakdown:

- **MCP Hosts**: These are your AI applications, like Claude Desktop or your custom LLM app that need data or tools.
- **MCP Clients**: Lightweight connectors that link the host to specific servers, handling communication.
- **MCP Servers**: Specialized programs that expose data or capabilities (e.g., a GitHub server fetching repo files) via the MCP protocol.

The magic happens in the **protocol itself**, which defines how data flows between these components. MCP servers can provide:

- **Resources**: Read-only data like files or database queries (e.g., file:///logs/app.log).
- **Tools**: Actions like searching the web or generating commit messages.
- **Prompts**: Reusable templates for consistent AI interactions.

For example, a developer might set up an MCP server for Google Drive. The AI host (say, Claude) connects via an MCP client, fetches a document, and uses it to answer your query in seconds. It’s modular, secure, and ridiculously efficient.

## MCP vs. RAG: What’s the Difference?

If you’re familiar with **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, you might wonder how MCP stacks up. Both aim to enrich AI with external data, in a complementary manner.

- **RAG**: Pulls relevant snippets from a large corpus (e.g., via embeddings) and stuffs them into a prompt. Great for dynamic, unstructured data but can get messy with complex workflows.
- **MCP**: Organizes context into structured layers (e.g., user queries, policies, retrieved docs) and connects to live systems. It’s more about systematic integration than ad-hoc retrieval.

Picture this: You use RAG to fetch web articles about a topic, then feed them into an MCP layer labeled “Research.” MCP then layers on your company’s style guide and user intent, ensuring the AI’s output is both informed and on-brand. Together, they’re a powerhouse.

## Real-World Use Cases: MCP in Action

Here are some killer applications using MCP:

1. **Code Smarter with Sourcegraph**

   Sourcegraph’s Cody uses MCP to pull in Postgres schemas or Linear issues, letting developers query their database or write code with full context right in their IDE.

2. **Streamlined Workflows with Slack**

   An MCP server for Slack lets your AI summarize threads, draft replies, or fetch files without leaving the chat interface.

3. **Dynamic Content Creation**

   Marketing teams can connect MCP to Google Drive, pulling in brand guidelines and campaign data to generate SEO-optimized content (like this blog!) in real time.

4. **Fleek-Powered AI agents**

   At Fleek, we’re excited about MCP’s potential for powering AI agents. Imagine an AI agent capable of connecting to any third-party service and handling any tasks given entirely on a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) powered infrastructure.

## Getting Started with MCP

Ready to dive in? MCP’s open-source nature and developer-friendly tools make it a breeze to adopt:

- **Pre-Built Servers**: Start with connectors for GitHub, Google Drive, Slack, and more.
- **SDKs**: Python and TypeScript SDKs to build custom servers fast.
- **Claude Desktop Integration**: Test MCP locally with Claude’s desktop app.

Here’s a quick code snippet to spin up an MCP server that exposes a calculator tool and some data using the MCP SDK:

```ts
import {
  McpServer,
  ResourceTemplate,
} from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js';

import { StdioServerTransport } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js';

import { z } from 'zod';

// Create an MCP server

const server = new McpServer({
  name: 'Demo',

  version: '1.0.0',
});

// Add an addition tool

server.tool(
  'add',

  { a: z.number(), b: z.number() },

  async ({ a, b }) => ({
    content: [{ type: 'text', text: String(a + b) }],
  }),
);

// Add a dynamic greeting resource

server.resource(
  'greeting',

  new ResourceTemplate('greeting://{name}', { list: undefined }),

  async (uri, { name }) => ({
    contents: [
      {
        uri: uri.href,

        text: `Hello, ${name}!`,
      },
    ],
  }),
);

// Start receiving messages on stdin and sending messages on stdout

const transport = new StdioServerTransport();

await server.connect(transport);
```

You can run that and connect it to your client like the Claude desktop application. To run the code, go to the terminal on your machine and then:

1. Create a directory using the below command:

```bash
mkdir mcp-server
```

2. Start a new Node project using the below command:

```bash
cd mcp-server
npm init -y
```

3. Create an `src` folder and then create a file called `index.ts` in it:

```bash
mkdir src
cd src
touch index.ts
```

4. Open the file in any code editor and then make sure the `package.json` matches the below:

```json
{
  "name": "mcp-fleek",

  "version": "1.0.0",

  "main": "index.js",

  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc && node -e \"require('fs').chmodSync('build/index.js', '755')\"",

    "esBuild": "esbuild --bundle ./src/index.ts --platform=node > bundle.js"
  },

  "type": "module",

  "bin": {
    "weather": "./build/index.js"
  },

  "files": ["build"],

  "keywords": [],

  "author": "",

  "license": "ISC",

  "description": "",

  "dependencies": {
    "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk": "^1.6.1",

    "zod": "^3.24.2"
  },

  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/node": "^22.13.9",

    "typescript": "^5.8.2"
  }
}
```

5. Run the below command in your terminal to install all dependencies for your server:

```bash
npm install
```

6. After that, you then build the server:

```bash
npm run build
```

With all that done, you can then proceed to [test your MCP server with a client](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/server#test-with-commands).
