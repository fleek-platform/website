As developers strive to create lightweight, responsive apps and websites, serverless computing platforms are becoming integral to the modern tech stack.

They provide an ideal balance of performance, cost-efficiency, and scalability, and enable developers to focus on building robust applications without worrying about infrastructure management.

Today, in 2024, a growing number of serverless computing platforms provide diverse capabilities, from enhanced flexibility and edge optimization to the rise of decentralized options.

But to choose the right platform, itâ€™s important to check out all the key players in the market, and evaluate several key factors.

**_So, in this article, we will dive into the best serverless computing platforms available today and explore how to select the ideal one for your next project._**

## **What is Serverless Computing?**

Serverless computing is a cloud application model where developers focus solely on writing and deploying code without managing the underlying infrastructure.
