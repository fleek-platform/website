# Fullstack Next.js with Fleek Next Adapter

The Fleek Next.js adapter enables seamless deployment of your server-side Next.js applications on Fleek. Built on [Fleek Functions](https://fleek.xyz/docs/cli/functions/) and powered by the Fleek Network, this adapter extends network capabilities to support full-stack Next.js apps on an unstoppable, edge-optimized infrastructure.

The Fleek Next Adapter opens doors to much more than standard Next.js deployments. We invite developers to experiment, build, and create powerful applications that address real-world challenges—while Fleek provides a high-performance, cost-effective, and open-source platform for your app’s infrastructure.

### Prerequisites

- Node 18+
- Fleek Account
- [Fleek CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fleek-platform/cli)
- [Fleek Next Adapter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fleek-platform/next)

---

### Setup

1. Start by installing the Fleek CLI.

```bash
// local installation
npm i @fleek-platform/cli

// global installation
npm i -g @fleek-platform/cli
```

💡: you can check the Fleek CLI version by running fleek -v. Any version >= 2.10.1 should be good.

2. Install the Fleek Next Adapter

```bash
// local installation
npm i @fleek-platform/next

// global installation
npm i -g @fleek-platform/next
```

💡: you can check the Fleek Next Adapter version by running `fleek-next -v`. Any version >= 2.1.0 should be good.

3. Install fumadocs using the automatic installation flow. Follow the terminal prompts and finish the installation.

```bash
npm create fumadocs-app
```

The installation flow should look something like this -

```bash
┌  Create Fumadocs App
│
◇  Project name
│  my-app
│
◇  Choose a content source
│  Fumadocs MDX
│
◇  Use Tailwind CSS for styling?
│  Yes
│
◇  Do you want to install packages automatically? (detected as npm)
│  Yes
│
│
●  Configured Typescript
│
●  Configured Tailwind CSS
◒  Generating Project│
●  Installed dependencies
│
●  Initialized Git repository
◇  Project Generated
│
└  Done


Open the project
cd my-app

Run Development Server
npm run dev | pnpm run dev | yarn dev

You can now open the project and start writing documents
kanishkkhurana@Kanishks-Air fuma %
```

When run locally, the project will look something like this -

![](./helloworld.png)

And, the /docs page will look like this -

![](./docs.png)

---

### Using the Fleek Next Adapter

1. Add the following code to any routes that run server-side code to ensure they run on the edge.

```bash
export const runtime = 'edge'
```

In our case, we will be adding the above code to the following files -

- /api/search/route.ts
- /docs/[[...slug]]/page.tsx

Please ensure that you remove the following code from /docs/[[slug]]/page.tsx

```javascript
// to be commented or removed from /docs/[[slug]]
export async function generateStaticParams() {
  return source.generateParams();
}
```

2. Build the project using the Fleek Next Adapter

```bash
npx fleek-next build
# or if installed globally
fleek-next build
```

💡: If you are running the command outside of your project's root dir, you can set the path to it with the project path flag `-p/--projectPath`:

```bash
fleek-next build -p path/to/my/repo
```

The build flow should look something like this -

```bash

🤖 Deploy your app by running the following command:
 ┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
 │ fleek functions deploy --bundle=false --path .fleek/dist/index.js --assets .fleek/static  │
 └───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
💡 Make sure to create a function first using `fleek functions create`
```

3. Now, Create the Fleek Function using the Fleek CLI

```bash
//syntax
fleek functions create --name '<name of your function>'

//example
fleek functions create --name fumadocs
```

4. Finally, deploy using the Fleek CLI

```bash
//syntax
fleek functions deploy --bundle=false --path .fleek/dist/index.js --assets .fleek/static --name '<name of your function>'

//example
fleek functions deploy --bundle=false --path .fleek/dist/index.js --assets .fleek/static --name fumadocs
```
