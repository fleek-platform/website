AI-powered agents are becoming an essential tool for automation, customer support, and interactive experiences. With the rise of **DeepSeek**, developers now have access to a powerful, open-source AI model that enables them to build intelligent applications with ease.

To make AI agent deployment even simpler and provide more optionality, **Fleek now integrates DeepSeek**, allowing users to spin up and host AI agents effortlessly. With just a few clicks, you can **deploy your own AI agent using a pre-made template**‚Äîno complicated setup required.

In this guide, we‚Äôll walk you through **deploying an AI agent to Discord using Fleek**, demonstrating how you can have your bot up and running in minutes.

## **Overview of What We'll Build**

In this guide, we will **deploy an AI agent to Discord** using Fleek‚Äôs agent templates. Instead of dealing with complex server setups or manual configurations, we‚Äôll leverage **Fleek‚Äôs seamless hosting** and DeepSeek‚Äôs powerful AI to get everything running quickly.

### **What This AI Agent Will Do**

- It will be able to **respond to messages** in a Discord server.
- You can **customize its personality**, making it casual, professional, or anything in between.
- It will run **entirely on Fleek**, so you won‚Äôt need to worry about infrastructure or maintenance.

### **Why Use Fleek for Deployment?**

- **Pre-made template** ‚Üí No need to start from scratch.
- **Serverless hosting** ‚Üí No manual server management required.
- **Fast setup** ‚Üí Deploy in just a few minutes.

Now, let‚Äôs get started by obtaining the required API keys.

## **Step 1: Get Your DeepSeek API Key**

Before we can deploy our AI agent, we need to **obtain a DeepSeek API key**. This key allows our bot to interact with DeepSeek‚Äôs AI models and generate responses.

### **How to Get Your DeepSeek API Key**

1. **Go to the DeepSeek website** ‚Üí https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys
2. **Sign up or log in** ‚Üí If you don‚Äôt have an account, create one.
3. **Navigate to the API section** ‚Üí This is usually found in your account settings or dashboard.
4. **Generate an API key** ‚Üí Click the button to create a new API key.
5. **Copy and store your key** ‚Üí Keep this key safe, as you‚Äôll need it in the next steps.

üí° **Tip:** Never share your API key publicly or expose it in your code. Use environment variables or a secure storage method when deploying your agent.

Now that we have the DeepSeek API key, let‚Äôs set up the **Discord keys** to allow our bot to interact with a server.

## **Step 2: Set Up Discord Keys**

Now that we have our **DeepSeek API key**, the next step is to set up the **Discord bot credentials** so our AI agent can interact with a Discord server. To do this, we need to generate a **Discord Bot Token and an Application ID** from the Discord Developer Portal.

### **How to Get Your Discord Bot Token**

1. **Go to the Discord Developer Portal** ‚Üí https://discord.com/developers/applications
2. **Click ‚ÄúNew Application‚Äù** ‚Üí Give your bot a name (e.g., "Dobby") and create the application.
3. **Navigate to the "Bot" tab** ‚Üí Click "Add Bot" to turn your application into a bot.
4. **Copy the Bot Token** ‚Üí Click "Reset Token" and copy the new token (this will be used later).
5. **Enable necessary permissions** ‚Üí In the "OAuth2" ‚Üí "URL Generator" section, select:
   - bot (under OAuth2 scopes)
   - Permissions like Send Messages, Read Message History, and Use Slash Commands.

### **Enable Privileged Gateway Intents**

To ensure your bot can function properly, you need to **toggle on the following intents** in the Bot tab:

- **Presence Intent** ‚Üí Required to track presence updates (optional for most bots).
- **Server Members Intent** ‚Üí Needed to interact with guild members.
- **Message Content Intent** ‚Üí Essential for responding to message content directly.

Make sure all three intents are **enabled**. These settings allow your bot to perform tasks like reading messages, responding to users, and interacting with server members effectively.

### **How to Get Your Application ID**

- The **Application ID** can be found on the main page of your app in the Developer Portal.
- Copy and store it safely alongside your Bot Token.

üí° **Important:** Keep your **Bot Token and Application ID** private! If your token gets leaked, anyone can control your bot.

Now that we have both **DeepSeek and Discord credentials**, it‚Äôs time to **customize our AI agent‚Äôs personality** before deployment!

## **Step 3: Customize Your AI Agent‚Äôs Personality**

Now that we have all the keys ready, it‚Äôs time to give your AI agent its unique personality. Head over to [**fleek.xyz/eliza/**](https://fleek.xyz/eliza/) and choose the option **‚ÄúStart with a Template.‚Äù** For this guide, we‚Äôll use the pre-designed **Dobby** template to create a fun, engaging AI agent.

### **Customizing Your AI Agent**

Fleek‚Äôs Eliza platform provides a variety of settings to make your AI agent truly unique. Follow these steps to customize:

- **Name:** Choose the display name for your AI agent. In this case, the agent will be named **Dobby**, representing a helpful and quirky personality.
- **Model Provider:** Toggle the option for **DeepSeek**, as it will power your AI agent‚Äôs responses.
- **Clients:** Select **Discord** to deploy your agent to a Discord server.
