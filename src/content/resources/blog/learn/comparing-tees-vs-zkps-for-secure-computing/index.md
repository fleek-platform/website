## **The Need for Secure & Verifiable Computation**

Modern computing faces the dual challenge of safeguarding sensitive data and maintaining trust in decentralized or distributed environments. Whether securing patient data in healthcare or scaling blockchain applications, today's systems demand innovative compute solutions.

Enter **Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)** and **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)**—two alternative technological approaches that enhance security, privacy and verifiability.  .

## **What Are Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)?**

[**Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)**](https://fleek.xyz/guides/understanding-tees-and-sgx-fleek/) are **hardware-based secure enclaves** that isolate sensitive computations from the rest of the system. By creating a protected area within a processor, TEEs safeguard the confidentiality and integrity of data, even if the system's operating environment is compromised.

### **How Do TEEs Work?**

TEEs operate by isolating critical processes, ensuring they remain inaccessible to unauthorized users or malicious software. Key features include:

- **Memory Isolation**: Data processed within a TEE is protected from external access.
- **Secure Boot**: Only verified, trusted software can run within the enclave.
- **Remote Attestation**: External parties can cryptographically verify the integrity of the TEE.

### **Popular examples**

- **Intel SGX (Software Guard Extensions)**: Offers enclave-based data protection.
- **Intel TDX (Trusted Domain Extensions)**: Expands on traditional TEEs by providing isolated execution environments at the virtual machine level, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of virtualized workloads, even in shared cloud infrastructures.
- **AMD SEV (Secure Encrypted Virtualization)**: Focuses on protecting virtual machine workloads.
- **Arm TrustZone**: Provides system-wide security for mobile and IoT devices.
- **Nvidia Confidential Computing: Provides TEE capabilities to Nvidia GPU’s, great for AI use cases (training, inference, etc.)**

### **Ideal Use Cases for TEEs**

1. **Confidential computing**

   TEEs shine in scenarios where sensitive data needs to be processed without exposure to external threats. Industries like **finance** and **healthcare** are prime examples:

- **Finance**: TEEs can securely process financial transactions, preventing unauthorized access to customer data, while enabling high-speed operations. For instance, TEEs might be used for secure multi-party computation (SMPC) in financial modeling or fraud detection.
- **Healthcare**: Patient data, such as genomic information, can be analyzed securely without breaching confidentiality. TEEs ensure compliance with regulations like HIPAA while enabling collaborative research or diagnosis without sharing raw data.

1. **Secure enclaves for cloud computing**

   With the rise of cloud adoption, organizations increasingly process data in off-premise environments. TEEs allow sensitive workloads to be executed securely on **untrusted cloud infrastructure**, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality even in the presence of malicious insiders or external attackers.

- **Examples**: Cloud providers like Microsoft Azure (using Intel SGX) and AWS Nitro Enclaves leverage TEEs to provide secure enclave services, offering organizations peace of mind when migrating to the cloud.
- **Applications**: Encrypted database queries, secure data sharing, and confidential machine learning models.

1. **Onchain applications**

   In the Web3 ecosystem, TEEs offer a solution for privacy-preserving computation on the blockchain. By isolating sensitive operations, TEEs allow developers to build trustless systems while maintaining performance.

- **Use Cases**: Verifiable computation, secure oracle services (e.g., Chainlink’s use of TEEs), and confidential contract execution in DeFi (Decentralized Finance).

### **Strengths of TEEs**

One of the standout advantages of TEEs is their ability to deliver high performance thanks to hardware acceleration. Because TEEs are implemented directly within the processor, they allow for the efficient execution of sensitive computations without compromising speed. This makes them an ideal choice for applications requiring real-time processing of confidential data, such as financial analytics or healthcare diagnostics. Importantly, **studies have shown that the computational overhead for TEEs is relatively low, at about 6%. This efficiency is a significant advantage when compared to more computationally intensive secure technologies like ZKP, which can require 100x-1000x the compute power for similar operations**. Another major strength lies in the ease of integration that tools like Fleek Machines offer. Traditionally, setting up TEE infrastructure was a complex and resource-intensive task, requiring a deep understanding of hardware and software. Fleek Machines change the game by offering a simplified, developer-friendly approach. With their support for Docker and remote attestation, Fleek Machines enable organizations to deploy secure computing environments quickly and seamlessly, saving both time and costs.

### **Limitations of TEEs**

TEEs have some limitations. They depend on specific hardware from manufacturers like Intel, AMD, or Arm, which can create supply chain issues like delays or shortages. Additionally, TEEs aren't immune to risks—poor implementation can expose them to side-channel attacks that exploit indirect data, like power use, to uncover secrets. Proper setup and regular updates are essential to maintaining their security. Furthermore, leveraging solutions like Fleek Machines allows developers to focus on building, while Fleek takes care of all the finer details like hardware and DevOps.

## **What Are Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)?**

Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are **cryptographic techniques** that allow one party (the prover) to demonstrate knowledge of specific information to another (the verifier) without revealing the actual information to anyone external to ‘the prover’.

### **How Do ZKPs Work?**

ZKPs rely on mathematical proofs to validate statements without exposing underlying data. Key types include:

- **Interactive ZKPs**: Require multiple back-and-forth interactions between prover and verifier.
- **Non-Interactive ZKPs (NIZKs)**: Use a single proof that the verifier can check without interaction.

### **Ideal Use Cases for ZKPs**

1. **Blockchain scalability**

   ZKPs are a cornerstone for enhancing blockchain scalability without compromising security or decentralization.

- **zk-Rollups**: These aggregate multiple transactions off-chain and submit a single proof to the main blockchain, drastically improving throughput and reducing gas fees.
- **StarkWare and zkSync**: Examples of platforms using ZKPs for scaling Ethereum and other blockchains while preserving user privacy.

1. **Private transactions**

   ZKPs enable anonymous transactions in cryptocurrencies by hiding transaction details (sender, receiver, and amount) while ensuring the transaction's validity.

- **Examples**:
  - **Zcash** employs zk-SNARKs for shielded transactions.
  - **Aztec Network** integrates ZKPs for privacy on Ethereum.
- **Real-World Implications**: Beyond financial privacy, ZKPs can also support private supply chain verification, where confidential supplier information is hidden, but product authenticity is ensured.

1. **Regulatory compliance**

   Regulatory requirements often demand proof of compliance without disclosing unnecessary details. ZKPs are ideal in this context:

- **AML and KYC Checks**: Prove a user meets anti-money laundering (AML) standards or has passed Know Your Customer (KYC) verification without exposing their full identity.
- **Environmental Compliance**: Certify that companies meet sustainability metrics (e.g., emissions thresholds) without revealing sensitive operational data.

### **Limitations of ZKPs**

However, ZKPs are not without their challenges. One of their primary limitations is their computational intensity. Generating and verifying proofs can require significant processing power, impacting performance, especially in systems that handle a high volume of transactions or computations. **The computational overhead of generating a ZKP can be 100x-1000x the compute power needed for similar operations in TEEs**. Moreover, implementing ZKPs often demands a high level of specialized knowledge. Developers working with ZKPs need expertise in advanced cryptography, and integrating these proofs into existing systems can be daunting. As a result, adoption may be slower in environments with limited resources or technical expertise.
