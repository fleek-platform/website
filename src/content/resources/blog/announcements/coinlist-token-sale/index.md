Fleek is launching its public token sale on **May 1** on [CoinList](https://coinlist.co/fleek) giving builders, creators, and believers in the AI agent economy a chance to own part of the infrastructure and ecosystem powering it.

The rise of AI agents is transforming the internet. Just as mobile reshaped how we access content, **autonomous agents and virtual influencers are redefining how we interact online**. Instead of static apps or dashboards, users will soon engage through chatting with agents that learn, act, and create on your behalf.

**Fleek is the Agentic Cloud**: the first platform purpose-built for deploying, managing, and monetizing AI agents and virtual influencers unifying LLMs, hosting, MCP’s, TEEs, agent capabilities, monetization tools, and more into a single, seamless experience and marketplace.

And now, it’s opening up that infrastructure to the public.

On May 1, Fleek launches its $FLK token sale on [CoinList](https://coinlist.co/fleek), giving early supporters the chance to own a stake in the infrastructure powering this agent-driven future.

### **What We’re Building**

Today’s AI infrastructure is fragmented and highly technical. Developers have to patch together LLMs, hosting, databases, memory, image/video generation, voice, lip sync, plugins, billing, etc., often across a half-dozen services. And consumers aren’t even able to join in on the agentic fun because of these technical barriers.

**Fleek fixes that.** It brings everything you need into one seamless, easy to use platform and marketplace, allowing anyone to create, manage, and monetize AI agents and virtual influencers. **Just as Shopify did for ecommerce and dropshipping, Fleek is doing for AI agents and the virtual influencer economy.** We are betting that virtual influencers will become the new dropshipping, and become the primary way consumers, especially younger generations, make money online in the coming years. And we plan to play a big role in that future vision.

## **The Agent Economy: A Generational Shift**

From AI customer support to virtual influencers, **AI agents are becoming the new interface of the internet**. They operate continuously, adapt in real time, meet users where they are, and can monetize themselves through services and campaigns.

The upcoming **Fleek Marketplace** will let creators list their agents and virtual influencers for enhanced discoverability and monetization through brand deals, content subscriptions, or pay-per-use experiences. Similar to the way social media platforms unlocked entirely new marketing and advertising channels, strategies, and opportunities, we believe social agents and virtual influencers are the new frontier that will unlock the next wave of innovation. Our goal is to be on the bleeding edge and help creators, brands, agencies, and companies push the boundaries of what’s possible.

As this shift accelerates, Fleek’s infrastructure and token will be critical to scaling the ecosystem.

## **Introducing $FLK: The Utility Token for the Agentic Cloud**

The **$FLK token** is the backbone of the Fleek ecosystem designed for developers, creators, consumers, brands, node operators, and even the AI agents and virtual influencers themselves.

Key utilities include:

- **Staking for access** to the Fleek platform, including credits and premium features
- **Enhanced visibility and monetization** opportunities for agents & influencers in the Marketplace
- **Incentivization** for creating agents & virtual influencers & bootstrapping monetization.
- **Exclusive** features and capabilities for brands and companies leveraging the marketplace for social amplification, influencer marketing, and UGC campaigns.
- **Burn mechanics** from marketplace and platform revenue
- **Staking** to become an operator and run Fleek infrastructure

## **Why We're Launching a Token with CoinList**

From the beginning, Fleek has been designed to empower builders and creators, not just serve them. As the Agentic Cloud grows, we believe the ecosystem behind it should be owned by those who build and interact on it.

That’s why we’re launching **$FLK**.

The token is a way to **align long-term value with the community**, and ensure the growth of this new agentic internet and virtual influencer economy doesn’t mirror the closed platforms of the past. $FLK gives participants real stake and real benefits within the platform and ecosystem.

We chose **CoinList** because it’s one of the few platforms that makes token access:

- **Global-first** and compliant
- **Transparent and fair**, with purchase limits and open eligibility
- **Retail and consumer-aligned**, not just optimized for institutions

By offering a **100% unlock at TGE** and a **significant discount compared to our last private round**, we’re giving early adopters, creators, and builders **better terms than private VC investors,** making it a true community-first launch that reflects how we want the ecosystem to grow: from the bottom up, not the top down.

Our goal is to distribute **ownership to those who will help shape and build the agentic future with us**.
