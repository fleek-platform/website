At Fleek.xyz, we offer an integration with GitHub for web hosting, but there are a few limitations to keep in mind when linking your GitHub account:

## Connecting personal GitHub accounts

Each Fleek user can link only one personal GitHub account to their Fleek Platform account. This limitation applies exclusively to connecting personal GitHub accounts â€” and not to GitHub organizations you are part of.

## Connecting GitHub organizations

You have full flexibility to deploy repositories from any GitHub organization to the desired Platform [project](/docs/platform/projects/). For example, each project under your Fleek account can have sites deployed using repositories from different organizations.

## Single GitHub source per project

Fleek allows you to connect both your personal GitHub account and organizational GitHub accounts to a single project.

This means you can:

- Deploy a site within the project from a repository in your personal GitHub account.
- Deploy another site in the same project from a repository in your organizational GitHub account.
