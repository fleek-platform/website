What’s up, Fleek Freaks?

We’re thrilled to share some exciting updates we’ve been working on for the Fleek platform over the past few weeks!
Here’s what’s new: Two-Factor authentication (2FA), our support center now integrated to the [fleek.xyz](https://fleek.xyz) site, a refreshed templates page and many more. ⚡

Let’s dive into what the team has been working on in July:

---

## Two-factor authentication (2FA)

Fleek users can now enable 2FA to ensure critical actions like deleting a project & inviting members are under your control.
